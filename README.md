Make sure to place a file in the root `./model.glb` â€” you can export models from Blender to `.glp`!

Currently the following is possible:

- Switch material (Oak, Balsa, Plastic)
- Rotate the object with arrow keys and mouse (Left click + move the mouse)

Run the following command to start a dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

Also, remember to run `npm install` first (doh! hehe).

If you are using Firefox, then note that this might only work from Chromium based browsers. E.g. Brave, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.
